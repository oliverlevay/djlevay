      ## **About me**


      I am a 30 years old Psychologist living in Stockholm, and I'm working as a
      DJ in my spare time. My drive and passion is to play music that my
      audience enjoy.  Thus, although I have my own preferences, I always ensure
      to adapt my music to the audience.

      Above you can see some of the music I have used at earlier events.
